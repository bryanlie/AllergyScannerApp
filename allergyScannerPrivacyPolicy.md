# Privacy Policy for Allergy Scanner

## Introduction

Allergy Scanner is an Android application that uses your device's camera and accesses your photo gallery to scan food labels for allergen information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data.

## Information We Collect

### Camera Access
Allergy Scanner requires access to your device's camera to capture images of food labels. These images are used solely for optical character recognition (OCR) to identify allergen information within the app.

### Photo Gallery Access
The app will ask permission to access images from your device's photo gallery. This allows you to scan allergen information from existing photos without needing to take a new picture.

### Photo Storage
The photos you take using Allergy Scanner or select from your gallery are processed within the app, and photos will be saved locally on your device. We do not upload or transfer these images to any external servers.

### Allergen Data
- **User-Defined Allergen Information:**  
  The app requires users to manually enter a list of allergens they want to monitor. This user-defined allergen information is stored locally on your device in the app's Room database. This data is used exclusively within the app to compare against text extracted from images and provide alerts if any matches are found.

- **Extracted Allergen Information:**  
  The allergen information extracted from images (via OCR) is processed temporarily and is not stored anywhere. This data exists only during the current session of the app and disappears when the app is closed or reset. It is used solely for real-time comparison with user-defined allergens.

## How We Use Your Information

### Image Processing
We use the camera and gallery images solely for OCR processing within the app. This process occurs entirely on your device and does not involve any external servers.

### Local Data Storage
All data, including photos and user-defined allergens, is stored locally on your device. We do not access, collect, or transmit this data externally.

## Data Retention and Deletion

You have full control over the photos and data stored by Allergy Scanner. You can delete photos and associated data at any time through the app's interface or your device's file management system.

## Permissions

Allergy Scanner requires the following permissions:

- Camera: To capture images of food labels for allergen scanning.
- Read External Storage: To access existing images from your device's gallery for allergen scanning.

You will be prompted to grant these permissions when you first use the relevant features. You can manage these permissions at any time in your device settings.

## Third-Party Access

We do not share any data with third parties. All processing occurs locally on your device.

## Security

We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your data. However, as all data is stored locally, the security of your information also depends on your device's security settings.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the app.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your data. As all data is stored locally on your device, you can exercise these rights directly through the app or your device settings.
